# StrokePrediction
 For my first coding course at BU, we were tasked with completing a project learn some basics about Big Data and Machine Learning.

*More updates to this README to come when time permits. For now, enjoy some images that came about during the project.*

#### NOTE: The write up about our project can be found in the file "LavoieDunnyard-EK125Project-FullDoc-FinalVersion" ([Here](https://github.com/pdvnny/StrokePrediction/blob/main/LavoieDunnyard-EK125Project-FullDoc-FinalVersion.pdf))
